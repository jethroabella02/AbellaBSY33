<p> <center> <font size="4" face="courier"> I am enrolled in the BS Psychology Program in De la Salle University-Dasmarias. This is my third choice among the courses I chose. My mother
suggested this course because she said that the field in this program is very wide so I have many options to choose from. But now, I am
enjoying this subject, I am enjoying this field of study. I became more and more interested about studying and interpreting behaviors
of other people. </center> </font> </p>

<p> <center> <font size="4" face="courier"> This is our block. we are merged last AY 2016-2017 due to the dissolved section of other
BSY students who didn't make it to the grade requirement. BSY 3-3 is composed of students from BSY 1-3 and BSY 1-4 </font> </center> </p>
<p> <center> <font size="4" face="courier"> At first, our block as BSY 3-3 is totally awkward because nobody is greeting each other, 
maybe we are just shy to each other at first because it is almost totally new faces.

<p> <center> <font size="4" face="courier"> Being in BSY 3-3 is a lot of fun because you will encounter different person with
different good traits. There are the wise and brainy ones, the crammers, the jokers, singers and many more. I can say that being in
BSY 3-3 is lot of fun. </font> </center> </p>
<font size="4" face="courier"> <center> <p> We established good friendship in our block even we have our own groups or tropas. But when we need each other,
they will be there especially when one is troubled in academics. We are doing our best to pass the quota grade in our program because
we do not want anymore classmate who will be dropped in the program. We are helping and supporting each other to succeed in 
this program. </font> </center> </p>

<p> <center> <font size="4" face="courier"> Out of 23 boys in BSY 1-3 and 1-4, we are now down to 5. Which makes more pressure to each of us.
But we are confident that the five of us will graduate in the BS Program next A.Y. because we are now bonded which makes us more dedicated to
work and study well. There is no bad influence in the group, so this is good. We are all aiming to graduate with high grades and we are working
hard especially on quizzes and exams. For the five of us, grade is very important. Being in the BS program, grade means almost everything to us.
<p> <center> <font size="4" face="courier"> But besides on the grades and academics, we are going out during our free time to have time
for relaxation. We go to malls, videoke, watch movie or go to our houses to hang out. Our friendship is built in the classroom and you can
see it on us inside or outside the campus. We got each other's back through any circumstances. And that is very important in friendship.
