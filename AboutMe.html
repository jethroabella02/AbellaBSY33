<p> <center> <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4.5"> Hi! My name is Jethro Pena Abella. Most of my friends call me Jeth. I am a 3 <sup>rd</sup> 
year BS Psychology student at De La Salle University Dasmarinas. I am 19 years old and lives in Bacoor, Cavite. I am a friendly
person because I like to be with my friends most of my free time. I enjoy playing sports especially table tennis and swimming.
I like swimming among all sports because I find it relaxing and fun. everytime I am in the water, I feel relaxed. </center> </font> </p>

<p> <center> <font face="courier" size="4.5"> This is my Family, my comfort place. My father is Ferdinando, he is working abroad and
 he is very close and sweet to us everytime. Our mother is Rosalyn, the most caring, loving and supportive woman I know. My first sibling is 
 Clarisse Jewel, she graduated in her grade school and high school as class valedictorian. And the baby in our family, Camille Joy.
 she is a very hard headed but a caring sister. She is my playmate when I am at home. </font> </center> </p>
 <p> <center> <font face="courier" size="4.5"> Everytime we have free time, we will go to malls or beaches or any places where we can 
 relax and have fun. We love going out most of the time except when it is super hot outside; we prefer to stay in our home, watch movies 
 order some food, and just chill with the air conditioner on. This is our family. Not that perfect but this is where I found love and happiness. 
 They are one of my major source of strength. No one could ever replace this family because I can say that we are happy every time
 with the presence of each other. </font> </center> </p>
